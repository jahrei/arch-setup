the future is here

~~I run Arch Linux as my daily driver. Serves me very well. In this repo you can find things that I use to maintain or modify Arch to my liking.~~

## UPDATE 2021-7-15:
I'm moving installs again. This repo will be deprecated soon.



## UPDATE 2021-1-16:
At the moment, this repo is currently being renovated in order to keep up with the rapid changes I am releasing soon to my system.
This README will be converted into a neat showcase on what exactly this repo is even for!

Nothing will really be permanent; as I keep rolling out the changes.

bleedingedge-rice will contain the most recent changes to my rice setup, until I can get one that I am happy with in order to pull.
