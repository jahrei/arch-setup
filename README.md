## UPDATE 2021-1-16:

I'm currently planning on revamping my personal rice, once I get the rest of my install configured to my liking once again (will take a while before that happens.

Some changes include switching from `Xorg` to `Wayland` (however I have an Nvidia card, so that will be trivial)

In the meantime, this repo is up for archival purposes.

I will also eventually add some setup information about my VM setups.

I also am in the process of making some wallpapers for personal use; you may be seeing them being rolled out in the future.

# My Linux Setup
I run Arch Linux as my daily driver. Serves me very well. In this repo you can find things that I use to maintain or modify Arch to my liking.

# RICING: Prerequisites / Sources 

`i3-gaps` - https://github.com/Airblader/i3 
- fork of i3 window manager; my main DE at the moment

`KDE Plasma` - https://github.com/KDE/plasma-desktop
- Original Desktop Environment before switching to i3
  - some elements of KDE are still present on my system

`polybar` - https://github.com/polybar/polybar 
- simple, easy to configure "taskbar" of sorts

`picom` - https://github.com/ibhagwan/picom 
- a fork of picom that contains `dual kawase blur` and `rounded corners`

`zsh` - https://www.zsh.org/ 
- powerful interactive shell for Linux
  - might switch to `FISH` shell

`ohmyzsh` - https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/ 
- zsh customization, unsure if willing to keep on system

`dunst` -
- a notifications daemon, highly configurable
  (note to self: required, a lot of applications freeze or become unstable without a notification daemon.)

# RICING: Optional packages/"For Fun"

`pipes.sh` - 
- placeholder text

`cmatrix` -
- little matrix title screen aesthetic in the terminal

`cli-visualizer/vis` -
- terminal visualizer for audio
  - may be removing it due to bugs with input sources

Currently finding a calendar to use; need an open-source solution that syncs well across Linux, Windows, Android, and iPhone.

# RICING: Guide & How to Clone 

WIP, probably not going to put this in for a while unless I'm really bored one day
If I do end up adding a guide, please refer to the Wiki.
