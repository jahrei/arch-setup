# BLEEDING EDGE: Ricing
This branch is simply for centralizing all changes I make to my system that involves ricing. Many things are going to be left in an unfinished/prototype state, so I really do not suggest cloning the dotfiles for yourself. Anything I deem a mature enough state will be heading to the `master` branch.

# My Linux Setup
I run Arch Linux as my daily driver. Serves me very well. In this repo you can find things that I use to maintain or modify Arch to my liking.
